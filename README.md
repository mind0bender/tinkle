# [Winks](https://winks.vercel.app/)

Winks is a simple note sharing application. It allows users to create and read small text messages.
It also allows users to share notes with other users.

> Winks does not need authentication to create, read or delete notes.
That also implies that anyone can read your note if they know the note id.

> Heavily inspired by [Online Clipboard](https://online-clipboard.online/online-clipboard/).
